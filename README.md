# zsmallnet

simple neural network designed for inlineable code optimizations

## Purpose

Small neural networks can unpack into almost no instructions to fit into a 20ns latency budget. They're capable of adequately solving more problems than people give them credit for, and many of those problems are extremely finicky to get right via classical programming (looking at you libinput).

I used to just write this sort of thing in assembly, but a heaping helping of "inline" lets Zig generate good-enough code (not even 10x worse). An example application is touchpad phantom event filtering in an X driver. Libinput locks the machine up misprocessing the stream of garbage, but there are only thousands of events per second, so a small neural network only uses 0.02% of a core to do the same work while maintaining stellar accuracy (0% fake events accepted, 0.3% real events dropped -- adequate for that use case because you don't get pointer drift but the observed behavior of dropped events is just that the mouse moves 0.3% slower).

## Installation

Zig has a package manager!!! Do something like the following.

```zig
// build.zig.zon
.{
    .name = "foo",
    .version = "0.0.0",

    .dependencies = .{
        .zsmallnet = .{
            .name = "zsmallnet",
	    .url = "https://github.com/hmusgrave/zsmallnet/archive/refs/tags/0.0.0.tar.gz",
	    // (I'll fill out the .hash field momentarily)
        },
    },
}
```

```zig
// build.zig
const zsmallnet_pkg = b.dependency("zsmallnet", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
const zsmallnet_mod = zsmallnet_pkg.module("zsmallnet");
exe.addModule("zsmallnet", zsmallnet_mod);
unit_tests.addModule("zsmallnet", zsmallnet_mod);
```

## Examples

The public API consists of a couple builtin loss functions and a neural network type. The network has a well-defined (i.e., bitcastable) memory layout, so if you're not doing anything too fancy you can just bitcast to an array of `u8` (or mmap the thing) and use `@embedFile` to read the trained network back in at comptime (build.zig _could_ handle training and loading in the network artifact, but training the network can benefit from having a person in the loop).

```zig
const zsmallnet = @import("zsmallnet");

test "dimensions line up at comptime, and the network learns a little" {
    var prng = std.rand.DefaultPrng.init(42);
    const rand = prng.random();

    const F = f32;
    const I = 2;
    const O = 1;
    const n = 100;
    var x: [n]@Vector(I, F) = undefined;
    var y: [n]@Vector(O, F) = undefined;

    // trivial regression problem that also has outputs in (0,1) so that
    // we can test logloss in the same method
    for (&x, &y) |*u, *v| {
        const a = rand.floatNorm(F);
        const b = rand.floatNorm(F);
        u.* = .{ a, b };
        v.* = .{@max(a + b, -a - b) / 10.0};
    }

    // gotta have something to train
    var network: zsmallnet.MLPRegressor(F, I, 8, O) = undefined;
    network.init(rand, &x, &y);
    var last_err: F = undefined;

    // TRAINING
    // 
    // Often at this stage you would print/log/store errors and other
    // details, you might have an auto-updating graph, or you could be
    // able to tweak learning rates or other parameters on the fly.
    // You might want to keep the best network you've found so far in case
    // things fly off the rails. Etc.
    //
    // Almost none of that traditional deep learning stuff matters when
    // shoving a small neural network at a simple problem. If you get a bunch
    // of NaN out, decrease the learning rate. If the error barely changes,
    // increase it. If the error is decreasing but not enough, increase the
    // loop count. If you want better results but can't afford a bigger network
    // in your latency budget, re-initialize (WITH A NEW RANDOM STATE), and try
    // again, since smaller networks are less likely to find something
    // approximating the global optimum if the problem is hard.
    //
    // If you're messing with probabilities you'll want to use LogLoss. If you're
    // predicting discrete classes you'll want to replace those with probabilities
    // and then choose a method for threshholding (e.g., replace {dog|cat} with
    // {prob_dog, prob_cat} (maybe using something like 0.1,0.9 instead of 0,1 to
    // "smooth" the probabilities and help the network train faster), and then choose
    // to always pick the class with the highest probability).
    // 
    // The 3 different loops here are just examples to show common ways the API
    // might be used. Most applications would just use one.

    // Mean Squared Error
    // Note the "abs_reduction" which is like gradient descent
    // but moves the error a linear amount in linear loss regimes
    // (i.e., large gradients result in slower travels -- effectively a
    // hybrid Hessian approximation method)
    for (0..100) |_| {
        const grad = network.batch_grad(rand, 32, &x, &y, zsmallnet.MSE(F, O));
        network = network.abs_reduction(grad, 1e-3);
        last_err = grad.err;
    }

    // We can do perplexity (logloss/entropy) too. The choice of .auto clips
    // things as close to 0/1 as we can get away with without causing nan/inf
    // to crop up
    for (0..100) |_| {
        const grad = network.batch_grad(rand, 32, &x, &y, zsmallnet.LogLoss(F, O, .auto));
        network = network.gradient_descent(grad, 1e-3);
        last_err = grad.err;
    }

    // You can specify your favorite clipping epsilon instead. Also notice that we
    // have standard gradient descent here rather than the "abs_reduction".
    for (0..100) |_| {
        const grad = network.batch_grad(rand, 32, &x, &y, zsmallnet.LogLoss(F, O, .{ .float = 1e-50 }));
        network = network.gradient_descent(grad, 1e-3);
        last_err = grad.err;
    }

    // it's a tiny network, and we didn't train very long, so err isn't 0
    try std.testing.expect(last_err < 0.2);

    // don't forget to use the network for something
    _ = network.forward(.{2, 0.5});
}
```

## Status

Tested and working on my machine on zig-linux-x86_64-0.12.0-dev.86+197d9a9eb. Syntax changes (especially RTI for the casting builtins) will necessitate updates to work with much older compilers.
